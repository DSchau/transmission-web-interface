### To-do

1. [ ] Integrate with transmission-rpc REST API
 * Use an angular factory to do this (already started)
2. [ ] Show status indicators on list item (% downloaded, completed, seeding/downloading, etc.)
 * Want to make this work with :active selector.. not sure how
3. [ ] When search icon is active, swap out the search icon to make it more visible search is active
4. [ ] Add a "footer" with various functionality, such as:
